v0.12.0 (Unreleased)
--------------------

- |API| |Feature| |Enhancement| TODO (Flesh this out further). Increased flexibility of what can be shown by the internally-calculated errorbars (:pr:2407).

- |Fix| |Enhancement| Improved robustness to missing data, including additional support for the `pd.NA` type (:pr:`2417`).

- TODO function specific categorical enhancements, including:

  - In :func:`stripplot`, a "strip" with a single observation will be plotted without jitter (:pr:`2413`)

  - In :func:`swarmplot`, the points are now swarmed at draw time, meaning that the plot will adapt to further changes in axes scaling or tweaks to the plot layout (:pr:`2443`).

  - In :func:`swarmplot`, the order of the points in each swarm now matches the order in the original dataset; previously they were sorted. This affects only the underlying data stored in the matplotlib artist, not the visual representation (:pr:`2443`).

  - In :func:`swarmplot`, the proportion of points that must overlap before issuing a warning can now be controlled with the `warn_thresh` parameter (:pr:`2447`).

- |Fix| In :func:`lineplot, allowed the `dashes` keyword to set the style of a line without mapping a `style` variable (:pr:`2449`).

- |Fix| |Enhancement| Improved integration with the matplotlib color cycle in most axes-level functions (:pr:`2449`).

- Made `scipy` an optional dependency and added `pip install seaborn[all]` as a method for ensuring the availability of compatible `scipy` and `statsmodels` libraries at install time. This has a few minor implications for existing code, which are explained in the Github pull request (:pr:`2398`).

- Following `NEP29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_, dropped support for Python 3.6 and bumped the minimally-supported versions of the library dependencies.

- Removed several previously-deprecated utility functions (`iqr`, `percentiles`, `pmf_hist`, and `sort_df`).
