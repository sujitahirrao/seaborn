v0.12.0 (Unreleased)
--------------------

- |API| |Feature| |Enhancement| TODO (Flesh this out further). Increased flexibility of what can be shown by the internally-calculated errorbars (:pr:2407).

- |Fix| |Enhancement| Improved robustness to missing data, including additional support for the `pd.NA` type (:pr:`2417).

- Made `scipy` an optional dependency and added `pip install seaborn[all]` as a method for ensuring the availability of compatible `scipy` and `statsmodels` libraries at install time. This has a few minor implications for existing code, which are explained in the Github pull request (:pr:`2398`).

- Following `NEP29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_, dropped support for Python 3.6 and bumped the minimally-supported versions of the library dependencies.

- Removed several previously-deprecated utility functions (`iqr`, `percentiles`, `pmf_hist`, and `sort_df`).
